# Product Sentiment & Emotion Prediction

![pic](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/759046413_640.jpg)

This project is for a sentiment detection service. The ideal use case is that
the prediction can be fed into logic for personalization.

***Example:***

*A customer in our financial app answers questions about their financial
prospects in a very pessimistic way; we could take the sentiment and then
trigger the tone of the product (copy, color, etc.) to be softer and/or more
encouraging.*
